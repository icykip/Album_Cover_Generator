#Creating Album Cover Art using Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs)

This project began as my final projecct for the CS231N Class at Stanford but after failing to succeed 
in arriving to satisfactory results I continued to work on it in the weeks following the end of spring quarter.

This project builds utilizes the work of [Erik Linder-Nor√©n](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN/tree/master/implementations)
for implementations of wgan and acgan as well as the work of [Rafael Bidese](https://github.com/rafaelbidese/LOGAN) for implentation of the
LOGAN archirecture.
